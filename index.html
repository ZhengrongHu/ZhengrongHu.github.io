	Battle Royale (|バトル・ロワイアル, Batoru Rowaiaru) is a novel written by Japanese author Koushun Takami. It was first published in Japan in April 1999, and it is one of Japan's best-selling and most controversial novels. It later formed the basis for a cult film (which spawned a sequel), and has been adapted as a 15-volume manga series, later adapted into English by Keith Giffen and published by TOKYOPOP, which itself now has a sequel.
	</p>
	<p>
	An English translation of the novel was published in the United States by Viz in February 2003, and has been available in the United Kingdom since July 2006 from Orbit Books. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The Viz book was re-released in 2009 with over 50 new pages, special features (including interviews with the original Japanese author & movie director), and some revised text (cleaning up translation issues mainly).
	</p>
	<p>
	Battle Royale takes place in an alternate timeline; according to the book's prologue, Japan is a police state, known as the Republic of Greater East Asia (大東亜共和国 Dai Tōa Kyōwakoku). From time to time, fifty randomly selected classes of secondary school students are forced to take arms against one another until only one student in each class remains. The program was created, supposedly, as a form of military research, though the outcome of each battle is publicized on local television. A character discovers that the program is not an experiment at all, but a means of terrorizing the population. In theory, after seeing such atrocities, the people will become paranoid and divided, preventing an organized rebellion.

  	42 9th graders are sent to a deserted island. They are given a map, food, and various weapons. An explosive collar is fitted around their neck. If they break a rule, the collar explodes. Their mission: kill each other and be the last one standing. The last survivor is allowed to leave the island. If there is more than one survivor, the collars explode and kill them all.
